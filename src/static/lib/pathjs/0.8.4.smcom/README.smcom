This is path.js 0.8.4 from https://github.com/mtrpcic/pathjs

For ASM, we've made 3 modifications:

1. Querystrings are extracted from paths and turned into an object, 
   accessible in your route callbacks as this.qs.[param] or in their
   raw form as this.rawqs

2. Rescue routes receive the unmatched path as the first argument.

3. Path.change(function(path) {}) allows you to listen for any changes
   to the current route and take action.
