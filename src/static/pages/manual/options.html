<h1>Options<a class="headerlink" href="#options" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>The main <em class="menuselection">Settings ‣ Options</em> page allows configuring of the
general preferences within Animal Shelter Manager.</p>
<div class="section" id="shelter-details">
<h2>Shelter Details<a class="headerlink" href="#shelter-details" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The shelter details tab allows you to enter contact information for your
shelter. This is used with reporting and internet publishing.</p>
<p>The “Visual Theme” option allows you to choose how the program looks. There are
a multitude of preset themes to choose from.</p>
<p>The “Server Adjustment” box allows you to set a time offset in hours from the
server clock. This is only necessary if your client is in a different timezone
from the server. For example, the main sheltermanager.com servers are in the
UK. East coast Americans will want to adjust the time by -5 hours to make sure
alerts appear at the correct time and reports are shown correctly.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="accounts">
<h2>Accounts<a class="headerlink" href="#accounts" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>ASM contains a full double entry accounting package. The options here are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Enable Accounts Functionality: Unticking this box will cause ASM to remove
all accounts related menu entries/buttons so that users do not see it, and
you will not be using ASM to manage your accounts.</li>
<li>Creating payments and payments types creates matching accounts and
transactions: When you create a new payment type, or log a new payment
against an owner/animal, ASM will automatically create a matching account in
the accounts system if one does not exist, and a matching transaction.</li>
<li>Creating costs and cost types creates matching accounts and
transactions: When you create a new cost type, or log a new cost
against an animal, ASM will automatically create a matching account in
the accounts system if one does not exist, and a matching transaction.</li>
<li>When receiving payments, allow the deposit account to be overridden: When
adding payments to the system, if you have the create matching transactions
option on as well as this one, a destination account dropdown will be shown
on payment screens allowing you to override the deposit account that the
donation will be applied to (the withdrawal account is always the donation
type&#8217;s matching income account).</li>
<li>When receiving payments, allow recording of sales tax with a default rate of %:
ASM can calculate and store sales tax/VAT/GST amounts on payments you receive
for taxable goods. Enabling this option will add a tickbox to all payment
screens allowing you to calculate the taxable value.</li>
<li>Only show account totals for the current period, which starts on: If you wish
to use accounting periods, put the start date in here. By enabling the show
account totals for current period option, the totals shown on the account
screen will only include transactions from this date or later.</li>
<li>Default transaction view: When viewing transactions for an account, ASM will
show transactions matching this time period. The default is the current
month.</li>
<li>Default source account for costs: When ASM creates a matching cost
transaction, it will use the cost type to find the expense account to use.
The source account here denotes where the money will be moved from. If you do
not set one, ASM will use the first bank account on file.</li>
<li>Default destination account for payments: When ASM creates a matching
payment transaction, it will use the payment type to find the income
account to use. The destination account here denotes where the money will be
moved to. If you do not set one, ASM will use the first bank account on file.</li>
<li>Donations of type … are sent to ...: In addition to the default payment
destination account, you can specify optional mappings, so that when ASM
receives a payment of a particular type, it uses the specified destination
account for it when creating the matching accounting transaction.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="add-animal">
<h2>Add Animal<a class="headerlink" href="#add-animal" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>ASM allows you to bulk add more than one animal at a time by just hitting the
“Create” button on the new animal screen instead of “Create and Edit” - this is
useful if booking in a litter of kittens and puppies for example. Here, you can
choose some extra fields for the new animal screen.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Show breed field(s): Allow entry of a breed</li>
<li>Use a single breed field for animals: Setting this option will make ASM only
display a single breed field on the animal details screen. This is the norm
for UK shelters, where animals are either pedigree or a crossbreed (a
“Crossbreed” breed can be added to the lookup). Without this option set, ASM
allows for two breed fields and a crossbreed indicator so that mixed breed
type animals can be recorded (this is typical for US shelters).</li>
<li>Show the color field: Allow entry of a specific colour</li>
<li>Show the internal location field: Allow entry of an internal location</li>
<li>Show the location unit field: Allow a cage/pen/kennel/hutch number to be set</li>
<li>Allow a fosterer to be selected: Allow new animals to be fostered straight
away</li>

<div class="section" id="age-groups">
<h2>Age Groups<a class="headerlink" href="#age-groups" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>It is possible to categorise your animals by their age in ASM. This is useful
when generating adoption paperwork and you don&#8217;t have an exact date of birth
for the animal. Instead, ASM can specify one if its groups, using the AgeGroup
wordkey (or animal.AgeGroup field in custom reports).</p>
<p>This tab allows you to choose the threshold for each grouping, as well as the
grouping name. By default, anything under 6 months (0.5 years) is classed as a
Baby, anything under 2 years is Young Adult, under 7 years is Adult and over
that is Senior.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="animal-codes">
<h2>Animal Codes<a class="headerlink" href="#animal-codes" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>ASM allows you to choose the format that animal codes will be automatically
generated in. ASM internally stores two codes for each animal, the “normal”
code, unique among all animals and the “short” code. The short code does not
have to be unique and is used by staff wanting to quickly identify animals in
conversation.</p>
<p>The defaults are TYYYYNNN (the first letter of the animal type, followed by the
year it was brought to the shelter, followed by a number unique within that
year for that type of animal) for the normal code and NNT for the shortcode (a
unique number within the year for the animal&#8217;s type, followed by the type).</p>
<p>You can build and use any format string you like, using the following tokens:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>YYYY - The year the animal was brought into the shelter (4 digits)</li>
<li>YY - The year the animal was brought into the shelter (2 digits)</li>
<li>MM - The month the animal was brought into the shelter</li>
<li>DD - The day the animal was brought into the shelter</li>
<li>E - The first letter of the animal&#8217;s entry category</li>
<li>EE - The first and second letters of the animal&#8217;s entry category</li>
<li>S - The first letter of the animal&#8217;s species</li>
<li>SS - The first and second letters of the animal&#8217;s species</li>
<li>T - The first letter of the animal&#8217;s type</li>
<li>TT – The first and second letters of the animal&#8217;s type</li>
<li>UUUUUUUUUU - (10 digits) a unique number representing the animal (this number
will never be used for another animal), padded to 10 digits. If the number
overflows, more digits will be used.</li>
<li>UUUU - (4 digits) a unique number representing the animal (this number will
never be used for another animal), padded to 4 digits. If the number
overflows, more digits will be used.</li>
<li>XXX - (3 digits) a number which is unique for all animals within the year</li>
<li>XX - A number which is unique for all animals within the year, no padding is
done.</li>
<li>NNN - (3 digits) a number representing the animal, which is unique within the
year brought in for the animal&#8217;s type and padded to 3 digits. If the number
overflows, more digits will be used.</li>
<li>NN - A number representing the animal, which is unique within the year
brought in for the animal&#8217;s type. No padding is done.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are some examples:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>YYYYMMDD-NNN-T (an ISO date, followed by a unique number/type within the
year). Eg: 20080520-001-D</li>
<li>TUUUUUUUUUU (the animal&#8217;s type, followed by a unique number for the animal) -
Eg: U0000003412</li>
</ul>
<p>If you change the coding formats when you already have animals on file using a
different format, those animals will be ignored when creating new codes and
multiple codes can co-exist.</p>
<p>Any values you put in your codes other than these tokens (such as punctuation
or other letters) will not be substituted and will be retained in generated
codes. For example, the format NNN:21:T will produce 001:21:D for the first dog
of the year.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Manually enter codes (do not generate): This option tells ASM that you don&#8217;t
want it to generate any codes. A code field will appear on the add animal
screen and apart from enforcing that codes are unique, ASM will do nothing
with the values entered by the user. Shortcodes can also be manually entered
unless the option to remove the box below is ticked.</li>
<li>Show short shelter codes on screens: This option tells ASM to display the
short code throughout the application instead of the main shelter code.</li>
<li>Remove short shelter code box from the animal details screen: Setting this
option will make ASM hide the short shelter code field at the top left of the
animal details screen. It does not stop ASM generating short codes behind the
scenes, it just stops them being visible on the screen.</li>
<li>Show codes on the shelter view screen: This option tells ASM to display the
code with the animal&#8217;s name on the shelter view screen and animal links on
the home page.</li>
<li>Once assigned, codes cannot be changed: Setting this option will make ASM
lock the shelter code fields, as well as the type and brought in date once an
animal record has been saved for the first time. This is to guarantee that
once an animal code has been handed out, it cannot be changed.</li>
<li>Allow duplicate microchip numbers: By default, the system will prevent you
entering or saving animals with a microchip number that has already been
allocated. In some situations this is desirable (for example, for figures
purposes some shelters prefer to create new animal records every time they
see an animal regardless of whether it has been through the shelter before).</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="costs">
<h2>Costs<a class="headerlink" href="#costs" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The costs tab allows you to specify a default daily boarding cost for new
animals (this value can be modified on the animal&#8217;s cost tab).</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Create boarding cost record when animal is adopted: If set, then during
adoption the total daily boarding cost for the animal will be converted to a
cost a record and given the boarding cost type.</li>
<li>Show a cost field on medical/test/vaccination screens: If set, a cost amount
box will be shown on medical, test and vaccination screens to store the cost
of treatments the animal received (this can then be reported on).</li>

<div class="section" id="defaults">
<h2>Defaults<a class="headerlink" href="#defaults" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This screen allows configuration of the system defaults. These defaults are
used to select starting values when finding and creating animals.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Mark new animals as not for adoption: Setting this option will cause ASM to
automatically tick the “not for adoption” box when creating new animals. This
is an extra precaution - by forcing users to untick the box when necessary,
no animal can be accidentally published.</li>
<li>Prefill new media notes for animal images with animal comments if left blank:
If no notes are given when adding images as media, ASM will default the
animal&#8217;s comments field.</li>
<li>Prefill new media notes with the filename if left blank: If the media being
added is not an image and the notes are blank, use the original filename as
the notes.</li>
<li>Include off-shelter animals in medical calendar and books: If ticked, animals
with outstanding medical/vacc/tests that have left the shelter will be shown
in medical books and the medical calendar.</li>
<li>When I change the location of an animal, make a note of it in the log: If
this option is on, a log record is created every time you change an animal&#8217;s
internal location with the new location so you can track the history of where
the animal has moved within your shelter.</li>
<li>When I change the weight of an animal, make a note of it in the log: If
this option is on, a log record is created every time you change an animal&#8217;s
weight so you can track the history of an animal&#8217;s wieght with reports and

<div class="section" id="documents">
<h2>Documents<a class="headerlink" href="#documents" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The documents tab allows you to change various settings related to generating
documents from templates.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Allow use of OpenOffice document templates: Browser based applications cannot
support native applications like OpenOffice as well as the browser-based word
processor built into ASM, however with this option on you can continue to use
OpenOffice templates. With this option enabled, the document template screen
will also allow you to upload OpenOffice documents as templates. When
generating a document from an OpenOffice template, ASM will substitute the
correct tags in the OpenOffice template and send the constructed document to
the web browser as a binary file with the correct mime type for display in
OpenOffice or download.</li>
<li>Printing word processor docuemnts uses hidden iframe and window.print:By
default when printing documents in the built-in wordprocessor, an iframe is
used to display and print only the document. This works fine for desktop web
browsers, but if you use mobile devices where the print command sends the URL
to a separate printing service, this will not work and you should untick this
option. Unticking this option will cause the print button to redirect to a
separate copy of the document by itself for use by mobile printing services.</li>
<li>Send PDF files inline instead of as attachments: If this option is on, ASM
will tell the browser to show PDF documents in the main page. Otherwise, it
will send them as attachments for you to download.</li>
<li>Include incomplete medical records when generating document templates: If
set, medical regimens will be included that are incomplete when accessing
them via LastX and Recent wordkeys.</li>
<li>Include incomplete vaccination and test records when generating document
templates: If set, vaccination and test records will be included that have
not been given when accessing them via LastX and Recent wordkeys.</li>
<li>When I generate a document, make a note of it in the log: If this option is
on, a log record is created every time you generate a document.</li>

shelter uses those).</li>
<li>Remove the Bonded With fields from the entry details screen: If ticked, ASM
won&#8217;t display the fields that allow an animal to be marked as bonded with
other animals (bonding is particularly common with rescues that deal with
rabbits and is the recommendation that pairs of animals are adopted
