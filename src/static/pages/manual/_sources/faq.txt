Appendix: Frequently Asked Questions
====================================

How do I add new vaccination types, breeds or internal locations?
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Go to :menuselection:`Settings --> Lookup Data`, and then choose them from the
dropdown list at the upper right side of the screen.

How do I bring an animal back to the shelter after adoption, transfer or fostering?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Open the animal's record and go the Movements tab. Find the current adoption,
transfer or foster movement, edit it and set a return date.

Where do I get some reports?
----------------------------

Go to :menuselection:`Settings --> Reports`, then click the "Browse
sheltermanager.com" button.  You can choose reports from the list and use the
"Install" button to add them to your database.

Why am I seeing "animal not in location filter/site" when I open a record?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

You've applied a "location filter" to your account. A location filter is a list
of locations attached to a user account that prohibits the user from seeing
animals who are not in one of those locations. To remove it, go to
:menuselection:`Settings --> System user accounts` and remove the location
filter items from your account.

Why do I get "page 1 of 1" in the header when I print documents?
----------------------------------------------------------------

Your web browser is adding these header and footers. Where you turn them off depends on your
web browser:

* Internet Explorer: Open Page Setup from the printer icon on the toolbar or
  File menu. Delete the header and footer strings in the "Headers and Footers"
  section

* Firefox: Choose Page Setup from the File menu (press ALT if it is not
  visible). Click on the Margins & Header/Footer tab and choose --blank-- from
  all the dropdowns in the Headers and Footers section.

* Chrome: Untick the "Print headers and footers" box in the print preview
  screen.
