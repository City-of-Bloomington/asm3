Mobile Interface
================

In addition to the web interface, ASM has a special interface for mobile
devices, such as your iPhone, Blackberry, WebOS or Android handset.

To access the mobile interface, follow the mobile link at the top right of the
login screen.

You can generate any report that doesn't require criteria and view the details
of all the current shelter animals.

You can also mark vaccinations and medical treatments given, add logs to
animals, dispatch and respond to animal control incidents, complete diary tasks
and mark homechecks as performed. This last item is very useful for volunteers
going out to homecheck owners prior to adoption.
