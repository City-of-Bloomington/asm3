Boarding
========

The boarding interface is used to administrate the boarding of animals, 
create due payments and invoice customers. 

Animals with an active boarding record will automatically move into the 
pre-selected shelter location on the check-in date and out again when the 
check-out date is reached.

Boarding Book
-------------

The boarding book located in the financial tab allows you to conveniently 
view boarding animals by selected periods and status.

Selecting an entry and clicking the create payment button allows you to create
a due payment based on the daily boarding fee and number of days boarded. You
can then use the payment screen to request payment from the customer or produce
an invoice.

Boarding Calendar

The boarding calendar is a calendar view, showing day, week and month
breakdowns of animals boarding at the shelter. The location assigned to that
animal for boarding is shown so that you can look for overlap and
double-bookings. Clicking on the animals name in the boarding calendar will
take you to the boarding tab of that animals record.
