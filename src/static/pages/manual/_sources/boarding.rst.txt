Boarding
========

The boarding interface is used to administrate the boarding of animals, 
create payments and produce invoices for customers. 

Animals with an active boarding record will automatically move into the 
pre-selected shelter location on the check-in date and out again when the 
check-out date is reached.

The boarding calendar is a full calendar view, showing day, week and month 
breakdowns of animals boarding at the shelter. Clicking on the animals name in 
the boarding calendar will take you to the boarding tab of that animals record.
